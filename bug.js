This error occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links.  The `Linking.addEventListener` method might not trigger as expected, specifically when the app is launched from a completely cold start (i.e., not recently in the background). This makes it difficult to handle incoming URLs immediately upon app launch.

```javascript
// in App.js
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';

Linking.addEventListener('url', (e) => {
  console.log('URL received:', e.url);
  // Handle the URL here
});
```
