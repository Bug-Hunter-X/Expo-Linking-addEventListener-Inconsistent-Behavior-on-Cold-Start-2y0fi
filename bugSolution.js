A more reliable approach involves checking for initial URLs synchronously using `Linking.getInitialURLAsync()` within the component's `useEffect` hook after the component mounts. This ensures that any URL present upon app launch is handled promptly.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

export default function App() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleInitialURL = async () => {
      const initialUrl = await Linking.getInitialURLAsync();
      if (initialUrl) {
        console.log('Initial URL:', initialUrl);
        // Handle the URL here
      }
    };

    handleInitialURL();
  }, []);

  // ... rest of your component
}
```
This solution ensures that deep links are handled correctly even on a cold start by checking for a URL synchronously before adding the event listener.  The event listener will continue to handle subsequent URLs as they arrive.
